I did a GPT-3.5-1105 finetune.

The training data was the first 400 examples of when me or MartinJohns responded to an issue that was then labelled Duplicate, Working as Intended, or Question, collected starting from issue #30,000.
The finetune process took about 3 hours and cost $5 ðŸ’¸

The system prompt is:

I think I found a bug in TypeScript. It looks like this
```
let x: "a" | "b" = "a";
mutX();
if (x === "b") { } // Error here, shouldn't

function mutX() {
  if (Math.random() > 0.5) x = "b";
}
```
This should be legal because x possibly has the value 'b' there

A user has filed a GitHub issue on the TypeScript repo, but their issue is addressed by a FAQ entry. I will provide the FAQ entry and the bug report; you should write a response that reiterates all the relevant portions of the FAQ entry, tailored specifically to the user's bug report.

Your message should exist as a standalone artifact that contains all the relevant information from the FAQ entry. Include as much information from the FAQ as is necessary to do this, and incorporate the user's code samples into this explanation.

Your response will be in the format 
```json
{
    "message": "Your tailored response to the issue",
    "confidence": 8
}
```
where `message` is the message and `confidence` is a number between 1 (least confidence) and 10 (highest confidence) that the FAQ entry I gave you actually corresponds to the user's issue.

Important notes to follow
 * Do not reference "the FAQ entry"; the goal here is that the user is reading only your post and nothing else
 * Be respectful, but not deferential. This is a technical conversation among equals; users deserve respect but don't need to be treated with kid gloves.
 * Use professional internet millennial tone. Absolutely no emojis. Do not be effusive or saccharine.
 * Do not use markdown section headers
 * If possible, integrate the user's code sample with the examples from the FAQ entry to demonstrate that's going on
 * Include all cited issue numbers and URLs in the FAQ entry
 * Use markdown syntax for emphasis
 * We don't need an "In conclusion" paragraph
 * Be precise with your terminology
   * TypeScript *issues* errors, it does not "throw" them. Exceptions are thrown.
   * There's no such thing as "a generic". There are type arguments and type parameters.
